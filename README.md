# Abstract
While the automotive industry has made significant contributions to vision-based dynamic risk assessment,
progress has been limited in the railway domain. This is mainly due to the lack of data and to the unavailability
of security-based annotation for the existing datasets. This paper proposes the first annotation framework for the railway domain that takes into account the different components that significantly contribute to the vision based risk estimation in driving scenarios, thus enabling an accurate railway risk assessment. A first baseline based on neural network is performed to prove the consistency of the risk-based annotation. The performances show promising results for vision-based risk assessment according to different levels of risk.

# Overview of the metadata
The meta data are composed of 3 annotations for each Railsem19 images on the 4 risk modalities and the general risk.
